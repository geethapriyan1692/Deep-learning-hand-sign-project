## Introduction
Sign language is a crucial means of communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. This project aims to build a deep learning model that can recognize and interpret sign language gestures.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains images of hand gestures representing different sign language alphabets. The images are stored in .npy format and are grayscale with a resolution of 64x64 pixels.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
## Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset and preprocess the images by normalizing them to the range [0, 1].
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Model Training:

Train the CNN model using the training data.
Monitor the training and validation accuracy and loss.

## Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model on the test set and report the accuracy.

## Visualization:

Plot training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs.


## Model Architecture
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following layers:

Conv2D layers for feature extraction
MaxPooling2D layers for downsampling
Flatten layer to convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector
Dense layers for classification

## Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. The training process involves 12 epochs with validation on the test set.

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=12, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated on the test set, and the test accuracy is reported.

test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc}")

## Results
Training Accuracy: The model achieves high accuracy on the training set.
Validation Accuracy: The model also generalizes well to the validation set.
Test Accuracy: The test accuracy is reported to be XX%.
